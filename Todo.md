* Build classes: Player, Team
* Add @staticmethod - ranking(), Player.ranking(), Team.ranking(), because they actually dont need an instance. This method get ranking of stats. Parameter: player_name/team_name, get ranking of that player/team; rank_by, rank stats by what metrics. Watch for multiple players with same name
* Build multiple constructor
