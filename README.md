# CBA-stats

This is a project to generate advanced stats using scraped CBA stats from Sina.com, http://sportsdata.misports.cn/.

## Run main.ipynb to Get Stats
To display some of the stats, run main.ipynb. You will need a ".env" file. 

An "env_file_template.txt" file is included. Replace password, username with your own username and password, and then change the file name to ".env" (yes, no filename extension needed).

Pro tip: Don't include space (" ") before or after the equal sign ("=").


## Update the Data
To update the data in the database, run UpdateData_v0.1.ipynb. You will need admin account to the datbase.
